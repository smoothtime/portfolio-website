  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>Hi. My name is James and I'm making this here website to learn.</p>
  <p>I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science, but never bothered learning much of anything about web frontend. So now that I'm attending SCAD, I wanted to prepare my own website for hosting my Technical Animation portfolio.</p>
  <p>If you somehow are reading this and are not James himself, this is probably looking pretty bare. Come back later to see this page in its full glory.</p>
